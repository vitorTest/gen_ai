To install Jupyter notebooks in a conda environment, use 
> conda install jupyter notebook.

Jupyter notebooks are also available through 
> pip with pip install jupyter notebook.

To start a notebook server, enter 
> jupyter notebook

That does not work... I don't know exactly how this works, but I think that
I have to activate conda first... But Do I have to create another environment?

To create another environment I had to consulting the udacity mini-course:
https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111 

Using 'conda env list' I see that there is only onee environment (base).
So I don't know if this is necessary, but I'll to create e new env for 
the course:
> conda create -n udmNLPpy-hero

I have created the file in the wrong path (I think so), so I remove it:
> conda env remove -n udmNLPpy-hero 

To see the created envs:
> conda env list

So, to activate it (I changed the name):
> conda activate udmNLPy0-hero

The path don't change (hue), the folder's course only will to have some notes.

The command 'jupyter notebook' still not working.
Now within the activated environment I'll try to install again:
> conda install jupyter notebook

voil√†! (yep, sometimes I'm very stupid. It was so obvious!).
